# To-Do App

This is a simple to-do app for the command line. It allows you to add, remove, and view tasks.

## Installation

Clone this repository and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. Ensure you have Node.js installed.
After installing the dependencies, you need to compile the TypeScript files and link the application to make it globally accessible. Run the following commands manually: (this should be done automatically after installing the dependencies, however, if it gets stuck, run these manually)

```sh
npm run tsc
npm link
```

## Usage

To use the app, run `todo` along with one of these commands:

* `add|a --name <task name> [--dueDate <due date>] [--description <description>] [--tags <"tag1 tag2 ...">"] [--effort <1-6>] [--importance <1-6>]` - Adds a task with the specified parameters.
  * You can also use the short versions: `-n <task name> [-d <due date>] [-m <description>] [-t <"tag1 tag2 ...">] [-e <1-6>] [-i <1-6>]`
  * The due date can be in any of the formats below:
    * `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `2024-06-05`)
    * `Month DD YYYY` (e.g., `June 5 2024`)
    * `DD Month YYYY` (e.g., `5 June 2024`)
    * For more info, check the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date#date_time_string_format)
  * the effort and importance parameters are a measure (from 1 to 6) of how important a task is, as well as how much effort is needed to complete the task. These values are used to calculate a *priority* score, which increases as the due date comes closer. It is calculated using the following expression: $\dfrac{2b}{\sqrt[a]{ d }}$, where $b$ is the importance, $a$ effort, and $d$ days until the deadline. If you want to see a graph of priority score over time, check this [Desmos graph](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/tawrfjp6m4)
* `complete|delete|c|d --name <task name> [--dueDate <due date>]`
  * You can also use the short version: `-n <task name>`
  * Removes the task with that name and due date. If no due date is specified and multiple tasks have the same name, it will remove the one with the earliest due date.
* `list|l [--tag <tag>]`
  * You can also use the short version: `-t <tag>`
  * Lists all tasks. If a tag is provided, will only show the tasks with that tag.
* `view|v --name <task name> [--dueDate <due date>]`
  * You can also use the short version: `[-d <due date>]`
  * Displays the info of a specific task.

For example:

* `todo a -n "buy groceries" -d 2024-06-05 -m "buy milk and bread" -t "tag1 tag2"` will create a task named "buy groceries" for June 5th, 2024 with the description "buy milk and bread" with the tags "tag1" and "tag2".
* `todo a -n work -d "July 2 2024" -e 5 -i 6` will create a task named "work" for July 2nd, 2024 with an effort of 5 and importance of 6.
* `todo l -t tag1` will show a table with all the tasks that have the tag "tag1".
* `todo v -n work` will show the info of the task named "work".
* `todo complete -n "buy groceries"` will remove the task named "buy groceries" with the earliest due date.

**Note**: If the task name or due date includes spaces, enclose them in quotes to ensure correct command execution.
Additionally, when running the `add` or `complete|delete` commands without specifying all parameters, you will be prompted in the console to input the missing information like so:

```console
> todo a

? name: buy groceries
? dueDate: 2025-06-05
? description: buy milk and bread
? tags: tag1 tag2
? effort: 3
? importance: 4
Task created:
buy groceries
buy milk and bread
Thu, 05 Jun 2025
[tag1, tag2]
3:4 - 1
```

## Tests

The app has unit tests written using Jest. Run `npm test` to execute the tests.

## Contributing
