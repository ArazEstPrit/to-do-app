# To-Do App

This is a command line-based to-do app that allows you to add, remove, edit, and view tasks.

## Installation

Clone this repository and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. Ensure you have Node.js installed.
After installing the dependencies, npm will automatically compile the code. You can then run the following command to allow the app to be run from anywhere using the `todo` keyword:

```sh
npm link to-do-app
```

## Usage

To use the app, run `todo` along with one of these commands:

* `add|a --name <--name <task name>> [--dueDate <due date>] [--description <description>] [--tags <"tag1 tag2 ...">] [--effort <1-6>] [--importance <1-6>]` - Adds a task with the specified parameters.
  * The `dueDate` field prompts for a date. It shows the current date by default in the `Mon 01 Jan 2025` format. You can use the *left and right arrow keys* to select different parts of the date. Once selected, use the *up and down arrow keys* to adjust the value. Press Enter to confirm the date.
  * The `effort` and `importance` parameters are a measure (from 1 to 6) of how important a task is, as well as how much effort is needed to complete the task. These values are used to calculate a *priority score*, which increases as the due date comes closer. It is calculated using the following expression: $\dfrac{2b}{\sqrt[a]{ d }}$, where $b$ is the importance, $a$ effort, and $d$ days until the deadline.

* `complete|delete|c|d --id <task ID>`
  * Removes the task with the specified task ID.
* `list|l [--tag <tag>]`
  * Lists all tasks, or filter them by tag.
* `view|v --id <task ID>`
  * Displays the info of the task with the specified task ID.
* `edit|e --id <task ID> [--name <task name>] [--dueDate <due date>] [--description <description>] [--tags <"tag1 tag2 ...">] [--effort <1-6>] [--importance <1-6>]`
  * Allows the user to edit the task with the specified ID. If no parameters are provided, the command will prompt for each field. Alternatively, specific fields can be updated directly by passing the corresponding flags.

**Note**: The following flag shorthands are available:
`--name`: `-n`
`--dueDate`: `-d`
`--description`: `-m`
`--tags`: `-t`
`--effort`: `-e`
`--importance`: `-i`
`--id`: `-k`

For example:

* `todo a -n "buy groceries" -d 2024-06-05 -m "buy milk and bread" -t "tag1 tag2"` will create a task named "buy groceries" for June 5th, 2024 with the description "buy milk and bread" with the tags "tag1" and "tag2".
* `todo a -n work -d "July 2 2024" -e 5 -i 6` will create a task named "work" for July 2nd, 2024 with an effort of 5 and importance of 6.
* `todo l -t tag1` will show a table with all the tasks that have the tag "tag1".
* `todo v -k 1` will show the info of the task with id 1.
* `todo complete -id 23` will remove the task with id 23.

**Note**:

* If the task name or due date includes spaces, enclose them in quotes to ensure correct command execution.
* When specifying the due date in the command, use the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

If you omit any parameters or provide invalid values, you will be prompted in the console to input the missing/corrected information.
